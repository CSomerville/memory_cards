# Memory Cards
#### A card matching game for children and child-like adults in a sunny glade full of wild animals, some extinct. [Live Demo](http://104.131.60.34:8000)
---------
#### My plan is to implement this game in a few different frameworks, as a way to extend my knowledge. Thus far, Backbone is complete and Angular in the works:

# Angular Version:
* ### The stack:
  * __mongodb__ - to persist high scores.
  * __node's http module__ - fun to make, minimal server.
  * __angularjs__ - to put dollar signs in front of things.
  * __other technologies__ - mongoose, less, gulp

# Backbone Version:
* ### The stack:
  * __postgresql__ - to persist high scores.
  * __express__ - a lightweight server.
  * __backbone__ - for a sturdy front-end

* ### Other technologies:
  * __bootstrap__ - for a responsive grid.
  * __less__ - to ease the displeasure of css.
  * __gulp__ - to build js and css files.
  * __pg__ - to connect node to the postgres database.
